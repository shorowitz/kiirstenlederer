        <h1>About</h1>
          <div class="about">
            <h3>While working 35 hours per week and attending college full-time, I became laser-focused on time management and organizational processes in order to achieve academic success, and excel in the jobs I held. From mornings in office administration to afternoons as a nanny to evenings in a restaurant, I wanted to be well-regarded by academics, 5-year- olds, and hungry New Yorkers, alike. I began scheduling my days down to the minute – including timetabling leisure activities like 30 minutes of reading – and instead of running from this formula, I became a total devotee to efficiency.</h3>
            <h3>After receiving my undergraduate degree from New York University, I transferred my experience in juggling multiple projects and deadlines to a position in marketing and business development within the legal realm. My next step was diving headfirst into the startup world as employee #2 of a field marketing platform. Having the opportunity to play with the building blocks of business, I discovered a great intersect between where the bandwidth of innovators is stretched the most, and what I love to do.</h3>
            <h3>When I unearthed my passion, I dove into the world of freelance, working with entrepreneurs and small businesses to uncover and alleviate their pressure points. By focusing on the little picture so that creators can focus on the big ideas, I help owners and team members get into their highest state of productivity by assessing what needs to be completed, when it needs to be finished, and ensuring implementation and proficient achievement of strategic goals.</h3>
